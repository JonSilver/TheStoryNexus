# The Absolute Basics

Welcome to The Story Nexus! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started with your AI-powered writing journey.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Quick Start (5 Minutes)**
> 1. Go to AI Settings → Add an API key (OpenAI, OpenRouter, or Local API URL)
> 2. Go to Stories → Create New Story → Enter title, author, language
> 3. Click the story card → Create New Chapter → Enter chapter title
> 4. Click "Write" button → Start typing or press `Alt+S` (`Option+S` on Mac) for AI assistance
> 5. That's it! Read the detailed guide below for advanced features.

## 1. Set Up Your AI Connection

Before you can use AI features, you'll need to connect to an AI provider. The Story Nexus supports OpenAI, OpenRouter, or a local AI model.

→ [Go to AI Settings](/ai-settings)

| Provider | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **OpenRouter** | Enter your OpenRouter API key to access a variety of models from different providers. |
| **OpenAI** | Enter your OpenAI API key to access models like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. |
| **Local** | Connect to a locally hosted model by entering the API URL (default: `http://localhost:1234/v1`). |

> [!TIP]
> After adding your API key, available models will be automatically retrieved. For local models, you'll need to click the "Refresh Models" button.

## 2. Understand Series vs Stories

The Story Nexus supports two ways to organise your writing:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Standalone Stories** | Individual stories that aren't connected to others. Perfect for one-off projects, short stories, or independent novels. |
| **Series** | Collections of related stories that share a world, characters, or timeline. Ideal for sequels, prequels, or interconnected narratives. |

> [!TIP]
> Series are optional. You can create standalone stories directly, or group related stories into a series later. Stories in a series share lorebook entries automatically.

## 3. Create Your First Story

Once your AI connection is set up, you can create your first story.

1. From the Home page, choose either **Stories** (for standalone) or **Series** (to create a series first)
2. For standalone: Click **Create New Story**, enter title, author, language, and synopsis
3. For series: Create a series first, then add stories to it from the series dashboard
4. Click on the story card to access your story dashboard

→ [Go to Stories](/stories) | [Go to Series](/series)

## 4. Create Your First Chapter

Now that you have a story, it's time to create your first chapter.

1. From your story dashboard, click **Create New Chapter**
2. Enter a title for your chapter
3. Optionally, set a POV (Point of View) character and type
4. Click **Create** to save your new chapter
5. Click the **Write** button on the chapter card to open the editor

## 5. Write with AI Assistance

The Story Nexus editor allows you to write manually or with AI assistance through Scene Beats.

### Using Scene Beats

Scene Beats are commands you give to the AI to generate content based on your instructions.

1. Press `Alt+S` (Windows) or `Option+S` (Mac) to insert a Scene Beat
   - *Alternatively, click on the menu and select Insert → Scene Beat*
2. Enter your command describing what you want the AI to write (e.g., "A tense confrontation between the detective and suspect")
3. Select a prompt template from the dropdown (scene beat prompts work best)
4. Select an AI model from your configured providers
5. Choose a **context mode** (controls which lorebook entries the AI sees):
   - **Use Matched Chapter** (default) - Includes lorebook entries that match text in your current chapter
   - **Use Matched Scene Beat** - Includes entries that match words in your scene beat command
   - **Use Custom Context** - Manually select which lorebook entries to include
6. The **Generate Prose** button becomes active once you've entered a command, selected a prompt, and selected a model
7. Click **Generate Prose** and wait for the AI to create content (streaming will show progress)
8. Review the generated content and click **Accept** to insert it into your story, or **Regenerate** to try again with the same settings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Editor Tips**
> - Be specific in Scene Beat commands: Instead of "continue the story," try "describe the character's reaction to the surprising news, showing their inner conflict"
> - **@ Autocomplete:** Type `@` in the editor to trigger lorebook tag autocomplete. Select a tag to quickly reference lorebook entries
> - **Word Count:** Real-time word count displays automatically as you write
